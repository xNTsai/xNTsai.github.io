			My name is Cheng-En Tsai, graduated from Hsinchu High School, and I study in National Taiwan University for Electronic Engineering. I was born in Hishchu, Taiwan, where famous for the windy weather.  Moreover, many people assert that there is no delicious dishes in Hsinchu, as a local who has lived there for almost 19 years, I have no word to debay for my hometown, I have no choice but to agree with the statements.  I have lots of hobbies, the favorite one I would say basketball, it is not just a sport for me, since basketball gives me chances to meet lots of friends in every stage of my life, no matter how busy I am, I would always spends time playing basketball with my friends! My favorite basketball player is Kyrie Irving, who play for <a href = "https://www.nba.com/nets/">Brooklyn Nets</a>, although they have lost in the play-off this year, I will still support them forever!  In leisure, I like listenging to Kpop music, especially my favorite singer and actress <a href = "https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/IU_(歌手)">IU</a>.  Besides, I love hanging out with friends, it make me feel free from the pressure of studying and homeworks.  We are planning to go to Tainan for four days to take a rest next week, I am looking forward to visit the historical site such as <a href="https://www.twtainan.net/zh-tw/Attractions/Detail/671">Anping Fort</a>, hope we have great time there!
